arduino project to control the filter pump of a swimming pool with effective use of solar absorbers

This project is based on the following (pre) conditions:
- There is just one pump for filtering and solar heater circulation
- At least two one-wire temperature sensors:
  - one at the top most point of the solar absorbers
  - one in the water
- Optional you may want to put some more sensors:
  - one air temperature
  - one directly on the controller itself to check its temperature manual

Further infos coming on demand...
